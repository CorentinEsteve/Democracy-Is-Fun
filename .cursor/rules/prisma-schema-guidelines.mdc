Use Prisma to define these models in schema.prisma:

model User { … }
model Community { … }
model Membership { … }
model Proposal { … }
model Vote { … }
model Opposition { … }
model Note { … }
model Event { … }
- Use enums for VoteType and Role.
- Set up proper relations and indexes.
- After any schema change, run `prisma migrate dev` and commit the SQL migration.
- Use a single shared PrismaClient instance exported from `prisma/client.ts`.
